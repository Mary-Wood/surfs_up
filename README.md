# surfs_up
This is a class project to analyze weather data to predict outcomes of a surf and shake startup in Hawaii. The analysis was to review the weather from weather reporting locations in Oahu to determine if the weather conditions were indeed ideal for the startup in that location. However, a further analysis was also conducted on the weather statistics for June and December. 

## Results
The results show the descriptive statistics for temperatures in June and December. 
* In June, the average temperature was 74.9, with lows of 64 and highs of 85. This is a ideal temperature range for surfing and enjoying shakes! ![June Temperatures](https://github.com/Mary-Wood/surfs_up/blob/main/Resources/June%20Statistics.png)
* The December average was 71, with lows of 56 and highs of 83. In general, this is still an ideal range for surfing with the lows still being moderate. ![Dec Temps](https://github.com/Mary-Wood/surfs_up/blob/main/Resources/Dec%20Statistics.png)
An additional analysis was conducted on the precipitation for those months. 
* The average rain fall in June was .14” with a min of no rain and a max of 4.43”. ![June Percip](https://github.com/Mary-Wood/surfs_up/blob/main/Resources/June%20Percip.png)
* The average rain fall in December was .21” with a minimum of no rain and a maximum of 6.42” of rain. ![Dec Percip](https://github.com/Mary-Wood/surfs_up/blob/main/Resources/Dec%20Percip.png)

## Summary 
In general, the weather in Oahu seems ideal for surfing and enjoying shakes. Additional analysis should be conducted to determine if the amount of rain is too much for safe or desirable surfing. The temperature seems to stay at a more consistent high during the month of June, while it does appear to fluctuate between lower ranges during the winter. There also appears to be slightly more rain in December than June.
